                <h3><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                    the ground.  Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
                    walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                <h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt
                    and gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping experience
                    includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running
                    water.  Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
                    for changing weather with light layers of clothing.  It's also
                    helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
