                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup 
                    symbols or codes placed in a file that is intended for 
                    display on a webpage.  These markup symbols and codes 
                    identify structural elements such as paragraphs, 
                    headings, and lists.
                </dd>
                <dt>Element</dt>
                <dd>
                    An element is the individual markup code that have their 
                    own specific purpose and are typically enclosed in angle 
                    brackets.  Elements commonly come in pairs that include
                    an opening and closing tag.
                </dd>
                <dt>Attribute</dt>
                <dd>
                    Attributes are properties that are associated with elements 
                    or tags and they modify or further describe the function
                    of an element.

                <dt>Document Type Definition</dt>
                <dd>
                    The Document Type Definition (DTD) identifies the version 
                    of HTML in the document.  Web browsers and HTML code 
                    validators use the information in the DTD when processing 
                    the web page.
                </dd>
                <dt>Character Encoding</dt>
                <dd>
                    Character encoding is the internal representation of 
                    letters, numbers, and symbols in a file, such as a web 
                    page or other file, that is stored on a computer and 
                    may be transmitted over the Internet.
                </dd>
                <dt>Body Element</dt>
                <dd>
                    The body element contains the body section, which begins 
                    with the &lt;body&gt; tag and ends with the 
                    &lt;/body&gt; tag.
                </dd>

                <dd>
                    The horizontal rule element, &lt;hr&gt;, 
                    configures a horizontal line across a web page.  
                    Since the horizontal rule element does not contain 
                    any text, it is coded as a void element and not in 
                    a pair of opening and closing tags.
                </dd>
                <dt>Description List</dt>
                <dd>
                    A description list can be used to organize 
                    terms and their descriptions.  The terms stand 
                    out and their descriptions can be as long as 
                    needed to convey your message.

                <dt>The Div Element</dt>
                <dd>
                    The div element has been used for many years to 
                    configure a general structural area or "division" 
                    on a web page as a block display with empty space 
                    above and below.

                <dd>
                    A site map is a diagram of the organization of a website.  
                    Creating the site map is one of the initial steps 
                    in developing a website.

                <dt>Antialiasing</dt>
                <dd>
                    Antialiasing introduces intermediate colors to smooth 
                    jagged edges in digital images. Graphic applications 
                    such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Fireworks can be 
                    used to create antialiased test images.
                </dd>
                <dt>White Space</dt>
                <dd>
                    White space is the term to refer to placing blank 
                    or white space (because paper is usually white) 
                    in areas around blocks of text increases the 
                    readability of the page.  For example, placing white 
                    space around graphics helps them to stand out.

                <dd>
                    The CSS selector is part of the CSS style rule
                    that can be applied to HTML elements such
                    as the element name, class name, or ID name
                </dd>
                <dt>Property</dt>
                <dd>
                    The CSS property specifies what is to be styled
                    by the CSS rule. The property is the first portion
                    of the declaration in the CSS rule.
                </dd>
                <dt>Declaration</dt>
                <dd>
                    A property and value make up a CSS rule declaration
                    and define what is being modified and to what value
                    the rule will modify the property.
                </dd>
                <dt>Style Attribute</dt>
                <dd>
                    The style attribute is set to the style rule 
                    declaration that is configured when performing
                    inline CSS styling.

                    The link element associates an external style 
                    sheet with a web page. It is placed in the 
                    head section of the page and is a stand-alone,
                    void tag that does not use a closing tag.
                </dd>
                <dt>ID Selector</dt>
                <dd>
                    An ID selector is used to identify and apply 
                    a CSS rule uniquely to a single area on a web 
                    page that used the element that is configured.
